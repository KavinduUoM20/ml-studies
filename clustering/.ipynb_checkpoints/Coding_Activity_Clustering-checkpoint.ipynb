We are interested in clustering the exoplanets based on these features. Note that an exoplanet is a planet located outside the solar system. You may read about them at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet. The features recorded are - `Mass` (in Jupiter mass), `Period` (in Earth days), and `Eccentricity`."

Also, make pairwise scatterplots of the three variables (on the original scale) and show the three clusters in different colors."
